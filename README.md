# diHMM v1.0
Here presents an improved implementation of diHMM, contributed by Stephanos Tsoucas and Yan Kai.

diHMM is a novel chromatin segmentation for annotating chromatin states at two length scales. It was originally developed and described in the publication *Multi-scale chromatin state annotation using a hierarchical hidden Markov model* ([Marco et.al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15011)). Detailed information of the project can be found at [this page](https://github.com/gcyuan/diHMM).
